SIEM and Information Security Incident Management

Objective:

The objective of this lab manual is to provide hands-on experience and practical exercises on Security
Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Information Security Incident Management.
Participants will gain practical knowledge on how SIEM works, its benefits, and best practices for
effective incident management.

Lab Setup:

For this lab, you will need access to a SIEM solution. You can either use a cloud-based SIEM platform
or set up a SIEM solution locally in a virtual environment. Additionally, ensure that you have access to
various network devices, servers, endpoints, and applications to generate security events.

Lab Exercises:

Exercise 1: Introduction to SIEM
Access the SIEM platform and log in with the provided credentials.
Explore the SIEM dashboard and familiarize yourself with the various components such as event logs,
alerts, and reports.
Review the preconfigured correlation rules and policies in the SIEM solution.

Exercise 2: 

Event Collection and Normalization

Configure data sources such as network devices, servers, endpoints, and applications to send logs to
the SIEM platform.
Verify that log data is being collected and normalized correctly by the SIEM solution.
Review the normalized log data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Exercise 3: 

Real-time Monitoring and Alerting

Set up real-time monitoring rules to detect specific security events or anomalies.
Generate test events or simulate security incidents to trigger alerts in the SIEM platform.
Verify that alerts are generated promptly and investigate the triggered alerts to assess their severity
and impact.

Exercise 4: Incident Investigation and Response

Analyze the details of the triggered alerts to understand the nature of the security incidents.
Investigate the affected systems and network devices to determine the root cause of the incidents.
Initiate response actions based on the severity of the incidents, such as isolating compromised
endpoints or blocking malicious traffic.

Exercise 5: 
Compliance Reporting

Generate compliance reports based on predefined templates or regulatory requirements.
Review the generated reports to ensure that the organization's security posture aligns with
compliance standards and policies.
Identify any areas of non-compliance and take corrective actions as necessary.

Exercise 6: Best Practices and Optimization

Review the best practices for SIEM deployment and operation.
Evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the SIEM solution based on key metrics such as
detection rate, response time, and false positives.
Identify areas for optimization and fine-tuning, such as updating correlation rules, adding new data
sources, or integrating additional security tools.

Lab Conclusion:

In this lab, you have gained practical experience in using a SIEM solution for security event
management and incident response. You have learned how to collect, normalize, monitor, and
analyze security event data, as well as how to respond to security incidents effectively. By following
best practices and continuous optimization, you can enhance the security posture of your
organization and mitigate potential threats more efficiently.
