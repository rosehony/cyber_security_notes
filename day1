Comparing SIEM with Other Cybersecurity Solutions

SIEM vs. IDS/IPS:
  - SIEM focuses on analyzing security events and logs from various sources, 
while IDS/IPS are network security solutions that monitor and prevent unauthorized access and malicious activities.

SIEM vs. Firewall:
  - SIEM provides visibility into security events and incidents across the network, 
whereas firewalls control incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security policies.

SIEM vs. Endpoint Protection:
  - SIEM monitors security events across the network, while endpoint protection 
solutions focus on securing individual devices from malware, unauthorized access, and other threats.

SIEM vs. UEBA:
  - SIEM correlates security events and logs to detect anomalies and threats, 
while UEBA solutions focus on analyzing user behavior patterns to identify insider threats and compromised accounts.

How SIEM & SOAR Compare
SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):
  - Collects and analyzes security event data to detect and respond to threats in real-time.

SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response):
  - Automates incident response processes, orchestrates security tools, 
and streamlines workflows to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of security operations.
