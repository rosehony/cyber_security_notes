### Day 12 - Information Security Incident Management with SIEM

#### Introduction to SIEM

- The goal is to detect and respond to security incidents effectively.
- SIEM combines the capabilities of Security Information Management (SIM) and Security Event Management (SEM).
- SIEM systems collect, correlate, analyze, and report on security-related data.

#### Definition of Security Incident Management

- **Security Incident Management** is the process of identifying, managing, and responding to security incidents.
- Involves detecting security threats, investigating incidents, and restoring normal operations.
- Goal: Minimize the impact of security breaches and prevent future incidents.

#### The Cybersecurity Incident Management Process

- **Detection**: Identifying security incidents through various means.
- **Assessment**: Assessing the severity and impact of incidents.
- **Containment**: Implementing measures to prevent further damage.
- **Investigation**: Conducting a thorough investigation to determine the root cause.
- **Remediation**: Developing and implementing a plan to address vulnerabilities.
- **Communication**: Keeping stakeholders informed about the incident's status.
- **Documentation**: Documenting all aspects of the incident management process.

#### How does SIEM work?

1. **Data Collection**: Collecting security-related data from various sources.
2. **Normalization**: Standardizing and normalizing the collected data.
3. **Correlation**: Correlating and analyzing security events in real-time.
4. **Alerting**: Generating alerts for suspicious activities.
5. **Investigation**: Providing tools for security analysts to investigate alerts.
6. **Response Orchestration**: Integrating with incident response tools.
7. **Reporting and Compliance**: Generating reports and audit trails for compliance.

#### Benefits of SIEM

- **Threat Detection and Response**: Real-time visibility into security events.
- **Improved Security Posture**: Identifying security weaknesses proactively.
- **Compliance and Reporting**: Facilitating compliance with regulations.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automating manual security tasks.
- **Risk Management**: Assessing and mitigating cybersecurity risks.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Staying vigilant to emerging threats.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Enhancing threat detection capabilities.
