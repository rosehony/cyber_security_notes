#### Four Levels of Data Classification

1. **Confidential Data**: Requires protection from unauthorized access or disclosure (customer PII, financial records).
2. **Public Data**: Intended for unrestricted access (marketing materials, public website content).
3. **Internal Use Data**: Not publicly disclosed, requires protection (internal memos, employee directories).
4. **Highly Sensitive Data**: Highest level of protection, extreme sensitivity (classified government info, sensitive business strategies).

This comprehensive overview highlights the importance of data classification, risk management, compliance, and data protection measures in ensuring the security and integrity of organizational data.
