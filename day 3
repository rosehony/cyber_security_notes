### Hacking as a Process

Hacking refers to the unauthorized intrusion into computer systems or networks to exploit vulnerabilities for various purposes. It typically involves the following stages:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information about the target system or network.
2. **Scanning**: Identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
3. **Gaining Access**: Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
4. **Maintaining Access**: Establishing persistence within the system or network.
5. **Covering Tracks**: Erasing evidence of the intrusion to avoid detection.

Understanding the motivations and methods of threat actors is essential for cybersecurity professionals to develop effective defense strategies and protect against cyber threats.
