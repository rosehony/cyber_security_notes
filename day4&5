### Slide 6: Cryptography Principles - Integrity

- **Detect any unauthorized modifications**: Integrity ensures that data remains unchanged during transmission or storage.
- **Hash functions and digital signatures verify data integrity**: Hash functions create unique digital fingerprints of data, while digital signatures associate sender's identity with the message to verify its integrity.

### Slide 7: Cryptography Principles - Authentication

- **Authentication verifies the identity of communicating parties**: Digital signatures and cryptographic protocols are used to authenticate parties.
- **HMAC provides a hash-based message authentication code**: HMAC ensures the authenticity and integrity of the message through hash functions.

### Slide 8: Cryptography Principles - Non-repudiation and Availability

- **Cryptography should not hinder availability and resist denial-of-service attacks**: Non-repudiation ensures that the sender cannot deny the authenticity or origin of a message.
- **Digital signatures provide non-repudiation by associating sender's identity with the message**: This ensures accountability and authenticity in communication.

### Common Cryptographic Concepts

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring only authorized parties can access information.
- **Integrity**: Ensuring data remains unchanged during transmission/storage.
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of communicating parties.
- **Non-repudiation**: Ensuring sender cannot deny sending a message.
- **Key Management**: Managing generation, distribution, and storage of cryptographic keys.

### Cryptography Principles

- **Symmetric Key Cryptography**: Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.
- **Asymmetric Key Cryptography**: Uses a pair of keys (public, private) for encryption and decryption respectively.
- **Hash Functions**: Creates unique digital fingerprints of data.
- **Steganography**: Hides data within another medium.

### Types of Cryptography

- **Advantages**: Provides confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and enables secure communication and transactions.
- **Disadvantages**: Requires computational resources, secure key management, and vulnerable to attacks if not properly implemented.

### Applications of Cryptography

- **Secure Communication**: Encrypting emails, instant messages, and voice calls.
- **Data Protection**: Protecting sensitive data like passwords and financial information.
- **Secure Transactions**: Securing online and financial transactions.
- **Digital Signatures**: Verifying integrity and authenticity of digital documents.
- **Blockchain Technology**: Ensuring security and immutability of blockchain data.
